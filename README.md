Gradle plugin which reports test results back to [Sauce Labs][1].

How does this plugin work:
- traverses recursively given location in you file system to retrieve all JUnit reports in XML format produced by your unit test framework
- parses them looking for **SauceOnDemandSessionID**
- reports test results back to Sauce Labs
- for every result reported back, it checks if Sauce Labs session was correctly updated
- if not, it gives a warning or an error
- it is unit test framework-agnostic, as long as produced reports are in JUnit XML format
- it expects your test classes to be in 1-to-1 relationship with Sauce Labs sessions

## Quick start guide

There is more than one way to apply this plugin to your project (**build.gradle**). You can either follow the guideline on [Gradle Plugin Portal][2] or the one below:

```
[...]

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        // always check maven central badge above for most recent released version number
        classpath "uk.co.automatictester:saucelabs-reporting-gradle-plugin:1.2.0"
    }
}

apply plugin: 'uk.co.automatictester.saucelabs-reporting'
```

Once you applied the plugin, you need to configure it:

```
saucelabsReportingSettings {

    // Filename pattern of JUnit reports. In most cases, stick to the default.
    // Version 1.2.0 and earlier:
    // filenamePattern = /TEST-(.)*\.xml/
    // Versions later than 1.2.0:
    // filenamePattern = "(.)*TEST-(.)*\\.xml"

    // Where to find JUnit reports. This will depend on your project setup and Gradle version being used.
    testResultsDir = 'build/test-results'

    // Sauce Labs credentials.
    user = <your-username>
    key = <your-access-key>

    // What to do if session status after updated is different from expected. Either ERROR or WARNING (default).
    // actionOnFailure = 'WARNING'
}

[...]
```

After you run your Sauce Labs tests, report their results to Sauce Labs:

```gradle reportToSauceLabs```
